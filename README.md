# lariat-project-thinkful

I did this project using Microsoft Excel and Powerpoint.  It is the first capstone project from Thinkful's Data Analytics Course.  It analyzes four tables of data provided by Lariat, a fictitious car rental company.  The objective is to give them strategies on how they can increase revenue and cut losses using the data provided.  In the Excel workbook, it lists the raw data, calculated data based on the three strategies provided, pivot tables on each strategy, and then a dashboard looking up year, make, and model of the car and providing count of that particular vehicle in inventory as well as cost, gross, and net revenue for baseline and each strategy.

The three strategies I looked at are as follows:

1.  Replace the bottom 10% of vehicles with the top 10% of vehicles based on net revenue
2.  Replace the bottom 10% of vehicles with the top 10% of vehicles based on rental count
3.  Increase fees at airport locations by 25%

The Powerpoint presentation was based of the Excel spreadsheet and goes over how I would present my findings.
